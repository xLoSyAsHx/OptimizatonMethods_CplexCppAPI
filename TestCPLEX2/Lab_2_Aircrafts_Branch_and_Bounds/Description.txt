Branch & Bounds. CPLEX C++ API


Algorithm:

1) Solve current model
2) Check if the model satisfy all constraints - possible solution found. Need to stop
3) Otherwise:
 a) Find decision var with greatest fractional part
 b) Create two new models in which founded variable will be:
   + X <= floor(X_value)
   + X >= ceil(X_value)
 c) Recursevily execute algorithm for 2 new models

Output parameters
bestObjVal - The greatest objective value (in maximization case)  
bestValsX  - Array of IloNumArray. Contains solutions for X  
bestValsY  - Array of IloNumArray. Contains solutions for Y  

Result for modified values and constraints

Best object value: 102000
